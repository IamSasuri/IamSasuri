I'm passionate about computers and technology, especially web development. I have studied LPIC-1 and gained a strong foundation in Linux systems, which deepened my interest in backend development and server management.

Currently, I'm focused on becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, and I'm excited to explore both the frontend and backend aspects of web development. I have experience with:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python, Django, Flask, Linux server management, with plans to learn more about Node.js, Express, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB
I love learning new technologies and tackling challenging problems. My goal is to build dynamic, scalable, and efficient web applications.

Feel free to connect with me!
